        <h2>What is the Laundry Queue System?</h2>
        <p>
            The Laundry Queue System is a web-based platform designed to help users manage and track the availability of laundry machines in campus facilities. This system integrates with real-time data from laundry rooms to show the current status of each machine, including whether they are available, in use, or out of order. It also provides estimated wait times for machines that are currently in use.
